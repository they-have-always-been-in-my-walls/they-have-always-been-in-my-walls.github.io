Here, I will try to archive every piece of content that I've consumed and have found interesting, separated into monthly blocks. Books, movies, web series, blog posts, music, all of them. For some, I'll jot down my thoughts on them here itself. For others (especially books, movies and web series), I might have a separate blog post dedicated to dissecting them.

* [Crimewave](https://youtu.be/ayc4Nv1fnZY?si=tB5riKBs5LkOeS0o) by crystal castles
* [This](https://near.blog/) blog by twitter microcelebrity, AI adjacent poster and lowercase supremacist [near](https://twitter.com/nearcyan) is what inspired me to start blogging in the first place. He writes well researched articles on a bunch of topics. There's always alpha to be found here.

### August '24
* A blog on the [Anki system](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) (meant for improving long term memory) by [Micheal Nielson](https://michaelnielsen.org/). I've recently been very paranoid of my percieved weakening of memory and cognitive function, and I stumbled upon this blog while going through some threads about memory augmenting on reddit.
